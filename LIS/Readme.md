## LIS based distance matrix##

# Description #

Here is a R implementation for distance matrix computation based on LIS.

## How to use ##
Make sure to put both file in the same path

`DM = LISdm(LISmatrix(x, n, k), nchar(x), k)`

`x` is the set of strings
`n` is the number of strings in `x`
`k` is the length of substring.
